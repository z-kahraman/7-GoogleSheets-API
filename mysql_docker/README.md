# Docker Compose Configuration for MySQL and Adminer

This Docker Compose configuration sets up a MySQL database and Adminer for easy database management.

## Prerequisites

- Docker

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.

### Start the Services

To start the MySQL database and Adminer, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The services will start running in the background. You can access Adminer at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to manage the MySQL database.

### Stop the Services

To stop the services, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers, but the data volumes will be preserved.

## Configuration

The Docker Compose file defines the following services:

- `db`: MySQL database container based on the `mysql:8` image.
- `adminer`: Adminer container for web-based database management based on the `adminer:4.8.1` image.

The MySQL container is configured with the following settings:

- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: The password for the root user (currently set to `test`).
- Port mapping: MySQL is accessible on port 3306 of the host machine.

The Adminer container is configured with the following settings:

- Port mapping: Adminer is accessible on port 8080 of the host machine.

The data for the MySQL database is stored in Docker volumes:

- `db-data`: Volume for storing the MySQL data files.
- `adminer-data`: Volume for storing Adminer data.
